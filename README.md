## üìñ Using the Software

You will find several options and features once the application is open. The key functions include:

- **Control Algorithms**: Choose from various centralized control algorithms that suit your needs.
- **Simulation Options**: Test how the manipulator will perform under different conditions.
- **Visualization**: View real-time simulations that show how the arms move and interact.

To make the best use of the features, consult the built-in help section for tutorials and guidance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è System Requirements

For smooth performance, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, or a compatible Linux distribution.
- **MATLAB/Simulink**: You need MATLAB installed on your machine, along with the Simulink toolbox.
- **RAM**: Minimum 8 GB of RAM for optimal performance.
- **Disk Space**: At least 1 GB of available space for installation.

Having an up-to-date system can enhance user experience and functionality.

## üìä Algorithm Capabilities

Our software implements several centralized control algorithms, including:

- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: An effective approach for managing dynamic systems.
- **Adaptive Control**: Adjusts to changing conditions for improved accuracy and performance.
- **Robust Control**: Ensures consistent performance under uncertainties in system models.

These algorithms enable precise manipulation of dual-arm manipulators, making tasks in industrial settings more efficient.
